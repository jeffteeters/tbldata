Each row in the following table lists source cells on the left and destination cells on the top. The first column with numeric values gives the number of source cells. The other entries gives FO, FI. FO is fan-out (number of target cells each source contacts) and FI is fan-in (number source cells going to each target). Currently, all values are for the cat.
